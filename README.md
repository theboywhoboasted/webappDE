This repo contains the code for a simple flask app that I built to practice my German vocabulary.

# Usage
- To launch the webserver, run: `./run_docker.sh`
- Once the server is up, you can access the webpage in a browser at `http://localhost:8080/`

# Deployed Version
I usually keep the latest version deployed at https://webappde-876216435818.us-central1.run.app/ (subject to change)
